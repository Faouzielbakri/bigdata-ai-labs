## Overview

This repository is designed to provide hands-on experience with Big Data and AI concepts. The labs cover a range of topics, including data processing, analysis, and visualization, as well as the implementation of AI models and algorithms.

Each lab is self-contained with its own HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, and can be accessed via GitHub Pages for quick viewing and testing.

## Labs

Each lab can be accessed by navigating to its URL:

| Lab Number | Description                        | GitHub Pages URL                                              |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lab 1      | Introduction to Data Visualization | [Lab 1](https://faouzielbakri.github.io/bigdata-ai-labs/lab1) |
| Lab 2      | Not yet                            | Not yet                                                       |

> **Note**: Each lab link will take you to a specific page for that lab on GitHub Pages.

## Setup

To run these labs locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Faouzielbakri/bigdata-ai-labs.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the repository**:

   ```bash
   cd bigdata-ai-labs
   ```

3. **Open any lab locally**:
   - Navigate to a specific lab folder (e.g., `lab1`) and open the `index.html` file in a browser to view the lab locally.

## Usage

Each lab has its own setup with an `index.html` file. Open the `index.html` file for each lab to view its content. The labs utilize JavaScript and D3 for data visualization, as well as other libraries as needed.

For example, to view **Lab 1**:

- Open `lab1/index.html` in a web browser.

To view the labs on GitHub Pages, use the following URL structure:

```bash
  https://github.com/Faouzielbakri/bigdata-ai-labs/labN
```

Replace `labN` with the specific lab number (e.g., `lab1`, `lab2`, etc.).
